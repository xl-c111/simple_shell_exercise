 * main - prints "$ ", wait for the user to enter a command

 * Return: Always 0
 * Description: ssize_t getline(char **lineptr, size_t *n, FILE *stream)
 *             - @lineï¼š ptr to a string, when we pass to getline, we use &line(type of char**)
 *                       because getline wants to allocate and reallocate memory and change the value of line
 *             - @n: to store the allocated buffer size. If *line is NULL or not large enough, getline will use realloc to resize it
 *             - @stream: the standard input stream, getline reads from this stream, so it will wait user to type sth and hit enter
